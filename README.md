🌟 Day 7: Solving Problems on GeeksforGeeks 🚀

Hey everyone! 👋 I'm excited to share the progress I made on Day 7 of my 50-day LeetCode milestone challenge. Today, I tackled an interesting easy and medium level problem on GeeksforGeeks that helped deepen my understanding of hashing and set operations. Below are the details of what I tackled on Day 7.

Contents:
1. First Repeating Element
    - Approach: Used hash to keep track of element counts and their first occurrence.
    - Time Complexity: O(n) ⏳

2. Common Elements
    - Approach: Used set to find common elements between three arrays.
    - Time Complexity: O(n + m + p) ⏳

Why This Matters:
Practicing these types of problems on GeeksforGeeks helps in developing a deeper understanding of essential algorithms and data structures, which is crucial for acing technical interviews and improving coding skills.

Repository Structure:
- `first_repeating_element.cpp`: Contains the code for solving the "First Repeating Element" problem using hashing.
- `common_elements.cpp`: Contains the code for solving the "Common Elements" problem using sets.
- `README.md`: This readme file explaining the purpose and usage of the code files.

How to Use:
- Explore the code examples in the respective files to understand the approaches used to solve these problems.
- Use these examples as a reference for your own projects and studies.
